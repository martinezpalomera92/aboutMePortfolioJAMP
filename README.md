# üßë‚Äçüíª Jaime Mart√≠nez | Junior Full-Stack Developer Portfolio

This is the personal portfolio of Jaime Armando Mart√≠nez Palomera, showcasing his skills, experience, and projects as a Junior Full-Stack Java Developer. The site features a clean, responsive design, dynamic animations, and full bilingual support (English and Spanish).

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Bilingual Interface:** Full **English** (`en`) and **Spanish** (`es`) support, easily toggled via a navigation button. All main content, titles, and metadata are translated using `data-*` attributes and controlled via JavaScript.
* **Dynamic Typing Effect:** An engaging typewriter animation in the hero section cycles through the developer's key titles: "Jr. Full-Stack Java Developer," "Creative Problem Solver," and "Lifelong Learner."
* **Scroll Animations:** Sections dynamically **fade in** and **slide up** as the user scrolls them into view, implemented using the **Intersection Observer API** for optimized performance.
* **Responsive Design:** Built on **Bootstrap 5** to ensure optimal display and user experience across all devices (mobile, tablet, and desktop).
* **Clean Structure:** Clear separation of content into dedicated sections: About, Skills, Experience, Education, Certifications, and Contact.

## üí° Code Highlights

### Language Switching (main.js)

The project implements a robust bilingual system that avoids reliance on heavy third-party libraries.

1.  **HTML Data Attributes:** Content is translated using `data-lang-en` and `data-lang-es` attributes.
    ```html
    <h2 data-lang-en="About Me" data-lang-es="Sobre M√≠">About Me</h2>
    ```
2.  **JavaScript Logic:** The `switchLanguage` function reads the appropriate attribute (using the correct **camelCase** property access, e.g., `el.dataset.langEs`) and updates the element's `textContent`.

### Scroll Animations (main.js)

The `fade-in` animation is controlled by the **Intersection Observer API**, which is more efficient than listening to continuous scroll events.

```javascript
// main.js snippet
const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
    entries.forEach(entry => {
        if (entry.isIntersecting) {
            entry.target.classList.add('is-visible');
            // Stop observing to ensure the animation only runs once
            observer.unobserve(entry.target);
        }
    });
}, {
    threshold: 0.1 // Triggers when 10% of the element is visible
});
CSS Variables (style.css)
All primary, secondary, and background colors are managed via CSS Custom Properties (:root), allowing for quick and scalable theme changes.

CSS

/* style.css snippet */
:root {
    --primary-color: #3457D5;
    --primary-hover: #2a45a8;
    /* ... other variables ... */
}
